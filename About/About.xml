	[h1]New features in my continued version:[/h1]
	
	Compared to the abandoned old one, I added two new features:

1. Add Chinese Simplified and French translations

2. Add new mod options allowing to apply compressed raid stats to pre-spawn enemy pawns when a map is generated (attacking enemy settlement, for example).

Enemy pawns pre-spawn during map generation are not really "compressed" since they are not generated by storytellers, so you will still face the same number of enemies. Only stats power up are added to them. The stats magnitude is calculated separately, based on the current storyteller threat point of the RICHEST PLAYER SETTLEMENT (SOS2 spaceship included). Adjustable in mod config.

I haven't tested myself, but this addition may be useful especially if you want to make some late game scenario less boring, such as settlement attack or SOS2 ship boarding fight.
